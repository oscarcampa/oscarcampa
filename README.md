- 👋 Hi, I’m @oscarcampa
- 👀 I’m interested in physics of really really large objects . 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the suspicious and mysterious language of "code" and look to coding a rocket to Mars, but unfortunately I will have to stick with writing excel stuff... 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on project Koyash, and the electric components of making our system autonomous. We plan to save a few lives, make people smile,  and make things work for families in need
- 📫 In order to contact me, calling my phone is best. 4804041651. My email is : ocampa@asu.edu
